# Tests rules
- Create rules in AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) pattern. Don't add comments regarding AAA pattern.
- Avoid unnecessary comments in code.
- Create consistent tests naming pattern.
- If possible, use Theory instead of Fact. e.g. if you have tests which check parameters null, empty, whitespace, is better to use Theory with InlineData.
