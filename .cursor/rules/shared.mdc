## Coding practices

- Use feedback from linters to improve the code when making changes.
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
- Implement proper error and info logging and user-friendly error messages.
