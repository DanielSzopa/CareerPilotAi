            "Answer": "A customer was very frustrated because their software subscription had been renewed accidentally.

            "Question": "Imagine you have a long queue of support tickets, an urgent email from your manager, and a live chat request from a high-value client all at once. How would you prioritize these tasks?",
            "Answer": "I would first quickly assess the urgency and impact of each task. The live chat from a high-value client would be my top priority because it's a real-time interaction with a key account. I'd acknowledge the chat immediately. Next, I would quickly read my manager's email to see if it requires immediate action. If not, I would then turn my attention to the ticket queue, prioritizing the oldest or most critical tickets first, while keeping my manager informed of my workload if necessary.",

I need to consult with a specialist to get you the most accurate information. Can I place you on a brief hold, or would you prefer I call you back?'
